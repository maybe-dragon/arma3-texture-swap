# Arma 3 - Texture swap script
Dead-simple vehicle texture change script

Inspired by [GOM_fnc_aircraftLoadout by Grumpy Old Man](https://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=32755)

## Features
  - Change the texture of the currently controlled vehicle
  - Nothing else
  - Really
  
## Usage
 
- Copy the `scripts` folder
- Add (or merge) the class configs from `description.ext` to your own
- Set up the communication menu for all players (or just some players). See the example in `initPlayerLocal.sqf`

## Limitations

- Does not look very good for vehicles with more than 10 skins (eg. MH-900) (but it works just fine)
